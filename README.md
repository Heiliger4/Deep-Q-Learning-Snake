# Snake Game with AI Agent

This project is a snake game powered by a reinforcement learning agent, implemented using Python and Pygame. Follow the steps below to set it up and run it on your machine.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` (Python package manager)

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Heiliger4/ai-learning-agent.git
cd snake-game-ai
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a Python virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:

- On Windows:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install all required Python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Game
Run the game using the following command:

```bash
python agent.py
```

---

## Notes
- Ensure your terminal is in the project's root directory when running commands.
- If you encounter missing dependencies, check the `requirements.txt` file and install them manually:
  ```bash
  pip install <package-name>
  ```

---

## Troubleshooting
- If you see errors like `ModuleNotFoundError`, ensure you activated the virtual environment before running the script.
- If Pygame doesn't initialize correctly, check your Python version and ensure Pygame supports it.
